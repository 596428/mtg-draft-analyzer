# MTG Draft Analyzer - Scoring Configuration
# All weights and thresholds are configurable here

scoring:
  # Composite Score Weights (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    gih_wr: 0.45          # Games In Hand Win Rate - 핵심 성능 지표
    iwd: 0.20             # Improvement When Drawn (GIH - GNS)
    alsa_inverse: 0.15    # Average Last Seen At (희소성, 14 - ALSA)
    oh_wr: 0.10           # Opening Hand Win Rate
    gd_wr: 0.10           # Games Drawn Win Rate

  # Wilson Score Interval Parameters (Bayesian)
  bayesian:
    confidence_z: 1.96    # 95% Confidence Interval
    min_sample_size: 500  # Minimum games for reliable stats

  # Composite Score Scaling
  scaling:
    center: 50            # Z-Score 0 maps to this
    multiplier: 15        # Z-Score scaling factor

# Calibration Settings (Percentile-based thresholds)
calibration:
  # Card Categories
  synergy_percentile: 75      # Cards above this variance are synergy-dependent
  sleeper_percentile: 90      # Top 10% deviation = sleeper
  trap_percentile: 10         # Bottom 10% deviation = trap
  bomb_percentile: 95         # Top 5% GIH WR = bomb
  playable_percentile: 50     # Above median = playable

  # Variance thresholds (fallback if percentile calc fails)
  variance_fallback:
    synergy: 0.002            # 4.5%p variance threshold
    stable: 0.001             # Below this = very stable

# Color Strength Calculation
color_strength:
  weights:
    top_common_avg: 0.30      # Average of top 10 commons
    top_uncommon_avg: 0.25    # Average of top 5 uncommons
    bomb_factor: 0.20         # Rare/Mythic power level
    archetype_success: 0.15   # Color pair win rates
    depth_factor: 0.10        # Number of playable cards

  # Top N cards to consider
  top_n:
    common: 10
    uncommon: 5
    rare: 3

  # Stability weight range for synergy-dependent cards
  stability_weight:
    min: 0.80                 # Synergy-dependent cards weighted at 80%
    max: 1.00                 # Stable cards weighted at 100%

# Grade Assignment

  # Analysis prompts
  prompts:
    meta_analysis: |
      Analyze the following MTG draft meta data and provide strategic insights:
      1. Which colors/archetypes are strongest and why?
      2. Key sleeper cards that are undervalued
      3. Trap cards to avoid
      4. Recommended draft strategies

    card_analysis: |
      Analyze this card's performance data in the current draft meta:
      - Why might this card be over/under-performing?
      - In which archetypes does it excel?
      - Strategic considerations when drafting
