ECL:
  name: "Alchemy: Lorwyn & Shadowmoor"
  release_date: "2025-01"
  mechanics:
    - name: "Vivid"
      description: >
        An ability word that appears on cards that care about the number of colors among permanents you control.
        These abilities count the distinct colors among your permanents (0–5) and use that number in various effects
        as the ability resolves.
      strategy_tip: >
        Prioritize cards that generate or reward having multiple colors in play;
        deck archetypes that can fix to 3–5 colors will make Vivid effects more powerful.
    - name: "Blight"
      description: >
        A new keyword action involving -1/-1 counters. To blight N, put N -1/-1 counters on a creature you control
        as a cost or effect. This can be used on your own creatures to fuel additional benefits or on opponents'
        creatures to weaken them.
      strategy_tip: >
        Blight incentives often reward self-damage and board manipulation;
        look for synergies that remove or exploit -1/-1 counters to maximize value.
    - name: "Double-Faced Cards"
      description: >
        This set features nonmodal double-faced cards (transforming DFCs) that each have front and back faces.
        During your first main phase, many of these permanents have an ability to pay mana to transform to their
        alternate face, representing the shift between Lorwyn and Shadowmoor.
      strategy_tip: >
        Slots that reliably transform between states can provide flexible utility;
        consider how both faces contribute to your curve and interactions when drafting.
    - name: "Changeling"
      description: >
        Creatures with Changeling are considered to have all creature types, allowing them to count for any typal
        synergies. This supports tribal and synergy-based strategies without restricting to a single tribe.
      strategy_tip: >
        Changeling creatures act as flexible enablers for creature-type themes;
        in limited, they can help back up weaker tribal picks or enable multiple theme lines.
    - name: "Kindred"
      description: >
        Kindred is a card type added to noncreature cards that gives them a creature type for the sake of synergies.
        This allows some spells and permanents to interact with creature-type based cards or effects.
      strategy_tip: >
        Kindred cards can help round out creature-type strategies in draft;
        they are often more valuable when paired with other cards that care about specific tribes.
    - name: "Convoke"
      description: >
        A returning keyword allowing you to tap creatures to help pay for spells. Each tapped creature can pay
        either one mana of its color or one colorless mana toward the spell's cost.
      strategy_tip: >
        Convoke rewards wide boards; drafting creatures with evasion or utility increases the chances of
        casting high-impact spells ahead of schedule.
    - name: "Behold"
      description: >
        A returning mechanic where a card asks you to "behold" a specific creature type as part of a cost or effect.
        To behold something, choose a permanent you control or reveal one from your hand of the required type.
      strategy_tip: >
        Behold effects incentivize commitment to creature types;
        ensure you have enough of the right type early to reliably enable behold payoffs.
    - name: "Evoke"
      description: >
        A returning mechanic offering an alternate cost on permanents. You may cast a spell for its evoke cost, triggering
        enters-the-battlefield (and sometimes leaves-the-battlefield) abilities, after which the card is sacrificed.
      strategy_tip: >
        Evoke cards are useful tempo plays;
        draft them when you need early interaction or incremental advantage rather than late game finishers.
    - name: "Persist"
      description: >
        Persist returns on some cards, usually on the back face of double-faced cards. When a creature with Persist
        dies with no -1/-1 counters, it returns with a -1/-1 counter.
      strategy_tip: >
        Persist supports longer board games and combos with -1/-1 counter synergies;
        pick these when you have ways to remove counters or recur creatures.

DSK:
  name: "Duskmourn: House of Horror"
  release_date: "2024-09"
  mechanics:
    - name: "Survival"
      description: "Triggers when no creatures died this turn"
      strategy_tip: "Avoid trading in combat to maximize survival triggers"
    - name: "Rooms"
      description: "Split enchantments with two halves, each unlocked separately"
      strategy_tip: "Rooms provide late-game flexibility - evaluate both halves"
    - name: "Manifest Dread"
      description: "Look at top two cards, manifest one face-down as 2/2"
      strategy_tip: "Manifest dread smooths draws and enables surprise creatures"
    - name: "Eerie"
      description: "Triggers when enchantments ETB or Rooms are unlocked"
      strategy_tip: "Cheap enchantments and Rooms enable multiple eerie triggers"
    - name: "Impending"
      description: "Enchantments that become creatures after time counters removed"
      strategy_tip: "Impending provides inevitability in longer games"
    - name: "Delirium"
      description: "Bonus effects when 4+ card types in your graveyard"
      strategy_tip: "Self-mill and varied permanent types enable delirium"
